# GitHubMiner

A tool to mine (search and download) source code files of a given type from GitHub without the need to clone the entire project. Searches the whole file tree and downloads only matching files.

Needs the [HUB-SE-framework](https://github.com/hub-se/HUB-SE-framework) as a requirement to compile. (Download and execute 'mvn install' to add the needed jar-file to your local maven repository.)
